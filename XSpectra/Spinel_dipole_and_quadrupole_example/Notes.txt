Steps to produce dipole + quadrupole spectra:

Within dipole produce a run setup for dipole:

python MakeXSpectraForEachAtom.py

On a server: sbatch myjobn.sh
or locally: ./runallscf.sh and ./runallxspectra.sh

Once the dipole run is finished:

python PlotXSpectraXANES.py

Make sure the spectra are good.

Now set up the quadrupole calculation from the root of the directory (above dipole):

./makequadrupoles.sh

This will produce three quadrupole directories.  Check the files to ensure they are set up correctly and then run them.

Once done run all the python PlotXSpectraXANES.py.

Then go to Combine_Isotropic and:

python CombineQuadrupoleWithDipole.py

And if all the pieces are in place you should get a resultant isotropic spectrum.
